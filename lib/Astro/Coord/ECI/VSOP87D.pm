=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl module implements the VSOP87D model of planetary motion in a
manner that is consistent with the
L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI> hierarchy.

The VSOP87 models calculate the positions of the planets through Neptune
as a series of cosine terms. They were created by Pierre Bretagnon and
Gerard Francou of the Bureau des Longitudes in Paris France. Depending
on the model you select, you can calculate either instantaneous orbital
parameters, Heliocentric ecliptic position in either spherical or
Cartesian coordinates and either current or J2000.0 equinox, or
barycentric ecliptic position.

The models are stated to be within 1 second of arc for varying times
around J2000 (about noon January 1 2000 UT), as follows:

 4000 years for Mercury, Venus, Earth-Moon barycenter, Mars
 2000 years for Jupiter and Saturn
 6000 years for Uranus and Neptune

The actual model coefficients are available from
L<http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?VI/81/>, as is additional
information the accuracy of the model, and a reference implementation in
Fortran.

VSOP87D provides Heliocentric spherical coordinates referred to the
current equinox. This is consistent with the existing members of the
L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI> hierarchy, but more importantly
Jean Meeus' Astronomical Algorithms provides worked examples for the Sun
and Venus.

The VSOP87D model itself is simple enough to implement, and occupies
about 50 lines of Perl. Testing shows that the Perl solution for a given
body and time is within C<5e-9> of the Fortran reference implementation
over selected years in the range -4000 to 2300. The units of that
C<5e-9> vary, being radians for longitude and latitude, AU for radius,
and radians/day and AU/day for the corresponding velocities.

One of the advantages of the VSOP87 models over the previous VSOP82
models is that they are easily truncated when less than full precision
is required. Meeus has his own truncation, which is the default one. In
addition, this code provides truncation C<'none'>, which uses the whole
model, and a mechanism to define custom truncations.

As the examples make clear, the devil is in the details, and a
significant amount of work needs to be done to get from Heliocentric
geometric ecliptic coordinates to Geocentric apparent equatorial
coordinates. Meeus' examples are embodied in F<t/meeus_25b.t> and
F<t/meeus_33a.t>.

For the Sun, the Perl implementation agrees pretty well with the worked
example, differing by C<0.001> seconds of right ascension (B<not>
seconds of arc), C<0.007> seconds of declination (seconds of arc) and
C<1e-7> AU in radius.

For Venus, the Perl implementation agrees less well with the worked
example, differing by C<0.14> seconds of right ascension, C<0.07>
seconds of declination, and C<5e-8> AU in radius. I have gone over the
calculation step-by-step, and as of this writing most of the difference
seems to come in at the computation of Geocentric ecliptic position from
its Heliocentric Cartesian ecliptic position.  This is simply a square
root and two C<atan2()> calls, and if it is subtly wrong some way I can
not see it.

Because these are the only two worked examples I found in Meeus, I felt
the need to sanity-check the rest of the distribution in other ways.
These tests are contained in the F<t/planet_*.t> test files.

Rise and set times came from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO)
Rise/Set/Transit Times for Major Solar System Bodies and Bright Stars
page at L<http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/mrst.php>, and are given to
the nearest minute. These models almost always reproduce the USNO's
times in the cases tested. I have no idea how the USNO data are
calculated or to what accuracy.

Conjunctions and so forth came from Guy Ottewell's Astronomical Calendar
at L<http://www.universalworkshop.com/>, and are given to the nearest
hour. These models usually give the same. The 2018 edition also gives
JDE dates for the phenomena to three decimal places, or an accuracy of
about 90 seconds. These models typically are within about 10 minutes of
the Ottewell figures. Again I have no idea how the Astronomical Calendar
data are calculated or to what accuracy.

=head1 USAGE

This specific module is not intended to be used directly. Instead,
subclass a member of the L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI>
hierarchy and import methods from this module. In most cases this means
whatever the C<:mixin> tag provides, though for the Sun the C<:sun> tag
should be used instead. You must also provide a
L<__model_definition()|/__model_definition> method that returns the
model parameters you wish to implement. For the Sun, a
L<__model()|/__model> method is also required, since the design of this
distribution hangs the Earth's
L<__model_definition()|/__model_definition> information on the Sun.

But the end user does not do this either. Instead this distribution
provides three such subclasses:

=over

=item L<Astro::Coord::ECI::VSOP87D::Sun|Astro::Coord::ECI::VSOP87D::Sun>

This is a subclass of L<Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun|Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun>.
The L<__model()|/__model> method (private to this distribution) simply
returns zeroes. But this class carries the model parameters for the
Earth, which are subtracted from whatever L<__model()|/__model> returns
to get Geocentric coordinates.

=item L<Astro::Coord::ECI::VSOP87D::_Inferior|Astro::Coord::ECI::VSOP87D::_Inferior>

This is a subclass of L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI>, which
pulls in everything relevant from this module (i.e. imports C<:mixin>),
and provides almanac methods appropriate to inferior planets. Mercury
and Venus are subclassed from this.

=item L<Astro::Coord::ECI::VSOP87D::_Superior|Astro::Coord::ECI::VSOP87D::_Superior>

This is a subclass of L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI>, which
pulls in everything relevant from this module (i.e. imports C<:mixin>),
and provides almanac methods appropriate to superior planets. Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are subclassed from this.

=head1 METHODS

This module does not implement a class, and is better regarded as a
mixin. It supports the following methods, which are public and
exportable unless documented otherwise.

=head2 model_cutoff_definition

This method reports, creates, and deletes model cutoff definitions.

The first argument is the name of the model cutoff. If this is the only
argument, a reference to a hash defining the named model cutoff is
returned.  This return is a deep clone of the actual definition.

If the second argument is C<undef>, the named model cutoff is deleted.
If the model cutoff does not exist, the call does nothing. It is an
error to try to delete built-in cutoffs C<'none'> and C<'Meeus'>.

If the second argument is a reference to a hash, this defines or
redefines a model cutoff. The keys to the hash are the names of VSOP87D
series (C<'L0'> through C<'L5'>, C<'B0'> through C<'B5'>, and C<'R0'>
through C<'R5'>), and the value of each key is the number of terms of
that series to use. If one of the keys is omitted or has a false value,
that series is not used.

If the second argument is a scalar, it is expected to be a number, and a
model cutoff is generated consisting of all terms whose coefficient
(C<'A'> in Meeus' terminology) is equal to or greater than the number.

If the second argument is a code reference, this code is expected to
return a reference to a valid model cutoff hash as described two
paragraphs previously. Its arguments are the individual series hashes,
extracted from the model. Each hash will have the following keys:

=over

=item series

The name of the series (e.g. 'L0').

=item terms

An array reference containing the terms of the series.
Each term is a reference to an array containing in order, in Meeus'
terms, values C<'A'>, C<'B'>, and C<'C'>.

=back

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> or
C<:sun> tags.

=head2 geometric_longitude

This method returns the geometric longitude of the body. This is after
correction for aberration and light time (for bodies other than the Sun)
and conversion to FK5.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:sun> tag.

=head2 nutation

 my ( $delta_psi, $delta_epsilon ) =
     $self->nutation( $dynamical_time, $cutoff );

This method calculates the nutation in ecliptic longitude
(C<$delta_psi>) and latitude (C<$delta_epsilon>) at the given dynamical
time in seconds since the epoch (i.e. Perl time), according to the IAU
1980 model.

The C<$time> argument is optional, and defaults to the object's current
dynamical time.

The C<$cutoff> argument is optional; if specified as a number larger
than C<0>, terms whose amplitudes are smaller than the nutation cutoff
(in milli arc seconds) are ignored. The Meeus version of the algorithm
is specified by a value of C<3>. The default is specified by the
C<nutation_cutoff> attribute.

The model itself is the IAU 1980 nutation model. Later models exist, but
this was chosen because of the desire to be compatible with Meeus'
examples. The implementation itself actually comes from Meeus chapter
22. The model parameters were not transcribed from that source, however,
but were taken from the source IAU C reference implementation of the
algorithm, F<src/nut80.c>, with the minimum modifications necessary to
make the C code into Perl code. This file is contained in
L<http://www.iausofa.org/2018_0130_C/sofa_c-20180130.tar.gz>.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> or
C<:sun> tags.

=head2 obliquity

 $epsilon = $self->obliquity( $time );

This method calculates the obliquity of the ecliptic in radians at
the given B<dynamical> time. If the time is omitted or specified as
C<undef>, the current dynamical time of the object is used.

The algorithm is equation 22.3 from Jean Meeus' "Astronomical
Algorithms", 2nd Edition, Chapter 22, pages 143ff.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> or
C<:sun> tags.

=head2 order

 say 'Order from Sun: ', $self->order();

This method returns the order of the body from the Sun, with the Sun
itself being C<0>. The number C<3> is skipped, since that would
represent the Earth.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> or
C<:sun> tags.

=head2 period

 $self->period()

This method returns the sidereal period of the object, calculated from
the coefficient of its first C<L1> term.

The algorithm is the author's, and is a first approximation. That is. it
is just the tropical period plus however long it takes the object to
cover the amount of precession during the tropical year.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> or
C<:sun> tags.

=head2 synodic_period

 $self->synodic_period()

This method returns the synodic period of the object -- that is to say
the mean interval between oppositions or conjunctions of superior
planets or between corresponding conjunctions of inferior planets.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> tag.

=head2 time_set

 $self->time_set()

This method is not normally called by the user. It is called by
L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI> to compute the position once the
time has been set.

It returns the invocant.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> or
C<:sun> tags.

=head2 year

 $self->year()

This method returns the length of the tropical year of the object,
calculated from the coefficient of its first C<L1> term.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> or
C<:sun> tags.

=head2 __get_attr

This method is B<private> to this distribution, and may be changed or
revoked without notice at any time. Documentation is for the benefit of
the author.

This method returns the hash containing VSOP87D-specific attributes,
creating it if necessary.

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> or
C<:sun> tags.

=head2 __model

 my @state_vector = $class->__model( $time_dynamical, ... );

This static method is B<private> to this package, and may be changed or
revoked without notice at any time. Documentation is for the benefit of
the author.

This static method executes the VSOP87D model returned by
C<< $class->__model_definition() >>, and returns the computed state
vector. The components of the state vector are Heliocentric ecliptic
longitude and latitude in radians, radius in AU, and the associated
velocities in radians/day and AU/day.

Additional optional arguments can be specified as name/value pairs. The
following are defined:

=over

=item debug

If this Boolean argument is true, whatever debug data the author finds
useful at the moment is written to standard error. Only false values of
this argument are supported.

=item model_cutoff_definition

This is the model cutoff definition hash to use in the computation. If
unspecified the whole model is used.

=back

This method is exportable, either by name or via the C<:mixin> tag. It
is not exported by the C<:sun> tag.

=head2 __model_definition

 my $model = $class->__model_definition( 'model' )

This static method is B<private> to this package, and may be changed or
revoked without notice at any time. Documentation is for the benefit of
the author.

This static method returns model-related information. The argument
describes the information to return. The following arguments are valid:

=over

=item default_model_cutoff

This argument returns the default value of C<'model_cutoff_definition'>
for a new object.

=item model

This argument returns the terms of the VSOP87D model, expressed as
nested array references.

The top level is indexed on the zero-based coordinate index (i.e. one
less than the indices documented in F<vsop87.txt>. The next level is
indexed on the exponent of C<T> represented, and is expected to be in
the range C<0-5>.

The third level is a hash describing the individual series. It contains
the following keys:

=over

=item series

This is the name of the individual series (e.g. C<'L0'>.

=item terms

This is a reference to an array containing the terms of the series.
Each term is a reference to an array containing quantities A, B, and C
to be plugged into the equation C<A * cos( B + C * T) * T ** n>.

C<T> is dynamical time in Julian millennia since J2000.0.

=back

=item sidereal_period

This is the sidereal period in seconds, and is returned by period().

=item tropical_period

This is the tropical period, in seconds, and is returned by year().

=back

This method is B<not> exportable. It is expected that each derived class
will implement its own version of this method.
