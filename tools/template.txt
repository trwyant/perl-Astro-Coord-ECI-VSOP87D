=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl class computes the position of [% body %] using the VSOP87D
model. It is a subclass of
L<[% superclass %]|[% superclass %]>.

=head1 METHODS

This class supports the following public methods in addition to those of
its superclass:

=head2 model_cutoff_definition

This method reports, creates, and deletes model cutoff definitions.

The first argument is the name of the model cutoff. If this is the only
argument, a reference to a hash defining the named model cutoff is returned.
This return is a deep clone of the actual definition.

If the second argument is C<undef>, the named model cutoff is deleted. If the
model cutoff does not exist, the call does nothing. It is an error to try to
delete built-in cutoffs C<'none'> and C<'Meeus'>.

If the second argument is a reference to a hash, this defines or
redefines a model cutoff. The keys to the hash are the names of VSOP87D series
(C<'L0'> through C<'L5'>, C<'B0'> through C<'B5'>, and C<'R0'> through
C<'R5'>), and the value of each key is the number of terms of that
series to use. If one of the keys is omitted or has a false value, that
series is not used.

=head2 nutation

 my ( $delta_psi, $delta_epsilon ) =
     $self->nutation( $dynamical_time, $cutoff );

This subroutine (B<not> method) calculates the nutation in ecliptic
longitude (C<$delta_psi>) and latitude (C<$delta_epsilon>) at the given
dynamical time in seconds since the epoch (i.e. Perl time), according to
the IAU 1980 model.

The C<$time> argument is optional, and defaults to the object's current
dynamical time.

The C<$cutoff> argument is optional; if specified as a number larger
than C<0>, terms whose amplitudes are smaller than the model cutoff (in
milli arc seconds) are ignored. The Meeus version of the algorithm is
specified by a value of C<3>. The default is specified by the
L<nutation_cutoff()|/nutation_cutoff> value.

The model itself comes from Meeus chapter 22. The model parameters were
not transcribed from that source, however, but were taken from the
source IAU C reference implementation of the algorithm, F<src/nut80.c>,
with the minimum modifications necessary to make the C code into Perl
code. This file is contained in
L<http://www.iausofa.org/2018_0130_C/sofa_c-20180130.tar.gz>.

=head2 obliquity

 $epsilon = $self->obliquity( $time );

This method calculates the obliquity of the ecliptic in radians at
the given B<dynamical> time. If the time is omitted or specified as
C<undef>, the current dynamical time of the object is used.

The algorithm is equation 22.3 from Jean Meeus' "Astronomical
Algorithms", 2nd Edition, Chapter 22, pages 143ff.

=head2 order

 say 'Order from Sun: ', $self->order();

This method returns the order of the body from the Sun, with the Sun
itself being C<0>. The number C<3> is skipped, since that would
represent the Earth.

=head2 period

 $self->period()

This method returns the sidereal period of the object, calculated from
the coefficient of its first C<L1> term.

The algorithm is the author's, and is a first approximation. That is. it
is just the tropical period plus however long it takes the object to
cover the amount of precession during the tropical year.

=head2 time_set

 $self->time_set()

This method is not normally called by the user. It is called by
L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI> to compute the position once the
time has been set.

It returns the invocant.

=head2 year

 $self->year()

This method returns the length of the tropical year of the object,
calculated from the coefficient of its first C<L1> term.
