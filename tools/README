This directory contains various tools for maintaining this package, to
wit:

* README
  This file.

* decode
  This Perl script reads one of the files that describes a VSOP87 model,
  parses it, and deparses it into Perl using Data::Dumper. The input
  file is specified on the command line. If none, the input is read from
  standard in. Output goes to standard out.

* ref-data.f
  This Fortran 95 program is derived from example.f which is distributed
  with the VSOP87 model data. It is used to generate the files in
  t/data/ from the VSOP87 models and one or more time ranges.
  Documentation is in comments at the beginning of the source.

* reference
  This Perl script attempts to mimic the output of example.f using Perl
  classes. The --help option gets you documentation.

* template.pm
  This is a file suitable (perhaps!) for generating a complete planetary
  (but not Solar!) class using
  $ tools/decode -template tools/template.pm >...
  and its home-grown (yukkk!) templating system.
