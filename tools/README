This directory contains various tools for maintaining this package, to
wit:

* README
  This file.

* generate
  This Perl script generates the Perl module and t/data/ test file for
  planets named on the command line.

* generate.data
  This text file is input to ref-data to generate t/data/ files. See the
  comments in ref-data.f for details.

* ref-data.f
  This Fortran 95 program is derived from example.f which is distributed
  with the VSOP87 model data. It is used to generate the files in
  t/data/ from the VSOP87 models and one or more time ranges.
  Documentation is in comments at the beginning of the source.

* reference
  This Perl script attempts to mimic the output of example.f using Perl
  classes. The --help option gets you documentation.

* template.tpl
  This is a file suitable (perhaps!) for generating a complete planetary
  (but not Solar!) class using
  $ tools/generate -template tools/template.tpl >...
  and its home-grown (yukkk!) templating system.
